# IBM Q's Challenge Solution Folder

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks and Pyhon code related to the IBM Q's challenge.

 - [class_gates.ipynb Jupyter notebooks](class_gates.ipynb) contains Python routines used for calibrating qubits and qutrits using Qiskit Pulse, as well as custom gates constructs for single qutrits. The class **Calibration** contains reusable code that was used to run experiments on IBM Q's [ibmq_armonk](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/services?services=systems) backend. Working examples include plots and results obtained from the experiments.  

 - [gate_constructor.py](gate_constructor.py) is an extract of the Python code from the Jupyter notebook that can be leveraged in various applications.

 - [Presentation.ipynb Jupyter notebook](Presentation.ipynb) contains some additional examples and experiments results.
