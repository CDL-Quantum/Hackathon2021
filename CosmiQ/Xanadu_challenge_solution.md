# Xanadu's Challenge Solution Overview

In this project we are going to solve the Financial Portfolio Optimization problem using qutrits. Portfolio Optimization is the process of choosing the best portfolio out of the set of all portfolios being considered according to some measure like Expected Return or Minimization of Risk. This objective is central in the job of a professional asset manager no matter which financial institution they are working in. For instance, a head of investments in a pension fund, wants to compose their portfolio out of financial instruments that provide stable, low risk returns, so the investors into the pension fund can enjoy a safe financial future. Conversely, a Chief Investment Officer of a hedge fund aims to maximize their quarterly return and maximize their alpha (performance of the fund compared to the benchmark index).
