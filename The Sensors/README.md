# Implementing Quantum Sensing with Strawberry fields

## Project Description 
Qubic wants to bring quantum sensing to the $26 billion USD medical imaging market. The entrenched technologies (MRI, x-ray) are complex and expensive, giving many opportunities for disruption. As a platform for design exploration, we have adapted Xanaduâ€™s Strawberry Fields package to simulate quantum sensing systems. Leveraging their existing tools will speed research and development of breakthrough sensing systems.

## Setup

Make sure you have strawberry fields installed and configured as instructed at [strawberryfields.ai](https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_static/install.html).

## How to Use

Run the Jupyter notebook with utility.py in the same repository.
