## Project Description 
The inference method based on the maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt principle) asserts that the most suitable probability distribution compatible with a given set of constraints is the one with the largest entropy. This method is considered as a powerful estimation technique in a wide range of probabilistic models since it brings a solution to the universal problem of trying to stract information from partial or incomplete data.

Finding the MaxEnt probability distribution is considered a hard task due to the nonlinearities in the reconstruction algorithm. We have redefined the MaxEnt problem as a QUBO problem using a linearized entropy. As a proof of concept, we present a code that finds the MaxEnt probability distribution given the appearance frequencies of the faces of a dice as constraints. 

## Setup
- Make sure you have Ocean installed and configured. Follow the [instructions](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/overview/install.html).
- You need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. If you do not have it installed, follow this [instructions](https://jupyter.org/install).

## How to Use
To see the example showed in the code, all you need to do is run the cells pressing Shift+Enter.

## Challenge(s) You Solved
We proposed a solution for the DWave challenge.
