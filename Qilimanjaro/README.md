## Project Description 
We built a quantum classifier that uses a single qutrit, it is implemented by applying unitary gates to the qutrit parameterized by the rotation angles that can be understood as the hidden layers of a neural network. Those rotation angles also include the data that must be re-uploaded in each layer of the classifier. We first tested the classifier by doing some simulations where we trained the model using data generated by us and after that we tried implementing it in real quantum hardware.

## Project Details
Most quantum applications use qubits to process the information, that means we work on a 2<sup>n</sup>-dimensional Hilbert space since each qubit has 2 accessible states, |0〉 and |1〉. The state of these qubits can be easily modified using gates acting con that Hilbert space. However, we could also use higher energy states, for example we could use qutrits that can be in the states |0〉, |1〉 and |2〉 (or a superposition of those), but now the dimension of the Hilbert space becomes 2<sup>n</sup>3<sup>m</sup> where n is the number of qubits and m is the number of qutrits we have in our system.

In order to manipulate the state of the qutrits we can program directly the microwave pulses that we must apply to the qutrits. When the frequency of the pulse is ressonant with the gap between two energy levels, the population of these states will vary. This can be done using Qiskit Pulse which lets us program the frequency, amplitude and duration of the pulses we want to apply to our qubits/qutrits.

The goal of this project is to build a quantum classifier that uses qutrits to distinguish the different classes. The reason for that is because a classifier can be made using a single qubit by checking the fidelity with a set of maximally orthogonal states, if instead we use a qutrit, these states will have a larger orthogonality and therefore we will have less errors.

This classifier uses machine learning techniques, it consists on a set of unitary gates parameterized with some coefficients in the rotation angles that must be optimized during the training process via the minimization of a loss function. Each gate will take the previous state and the data of the element we want to classify as inputs and returns a quantum state as the output after weighting these values to get the angle of the unitary rotation. Note that the classical data must be re-uploaded in each gate due to the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics that doesn't allow us to copy the data points which are needed in every layer. The class of the elements is determined when the final's state fidelity with one of the maximally orthogonal states surpasses a certain value.

Additionally, it is important to mention that it is a good idea to minimize the quantum resources when trying to solve a given problem. In our case, we built a quantum classifier using a single qutrit, and that was possible because of the re-uploading data technique. It would also be possible to build a multi-qutrit classifier with a higher efficiency, but it would be more sophisticated and difficult to implement in larger algorithms.  

The size of the circuit grows linearly with the number of layers, and the number of gates of those layers also grows linearly with the size of the data. The classifier will perform better as we add more layers.


## Gates composition
Applying unitary gates to qutrits is a bit more complex than in qubits, for qubits we have the general U3 matrix given by 

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=U(\theta,&space;\phi,&space;\lambda)=\begin{pmatrix}&space;cos(\theta/2)&space;&&space;-i&space;e^{i&space;\lambda}&space;\sin{(\theta/2)}&space;\\&space;-i&space;e^{i&space;\lambda}&space;\sin{(\theta/2)}&space;&&space;e^{i(\lambda&plus;\phi)}&space;\cos{(\theta/2)}&space;\end{pmatrix}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U(\theta,&space;\phi,&space;\lambda)=\begin{pmatrix}&space;cos(\theta/2)&space;&&space;-i&space;e^{i&space;\lambda}&space;\sin{(\theta/2)}&space;\\&space;-i&space;e^{i&space;\lambda}&space;\sin{(\theta/2)}&space;&&space;e^{i(\lambda&plus;\phi)}&space;\cos{(\theta/2)}&space;\end{pmatrix}" title="U(\theta, \phi, \lambda)=\begin{pmatrix} cos(\theta/2) & -i e^{i \lambda} \sin{(\theta/2)} \\ -i e^{i \lambda} \sin{(\theta/2)} & e^{i(\lambda+\phi)} \cos{(\theta/2)} \end{pmatrix}" /></a>

That can be decomposed as

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=U(\theta,&space;\phi,&space;\lambda)=Z_{\phi-\pi&space;/&space;2}&space;X_{\pi&space;/&space;2}&space;Z_{\pi-\theta}&space;X_{\pi&space;/&space;2}&space;Z_{\lambda-\pi&space;/&space;2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U(\theta,&space;\phi,&space;\lambda)=Z_{\phi-\pi&space;/&space;2}&space;X_{\pi&space;/&space;2}&space;Z_{\pi-\theta}&space;X_{\pi&space;/&space;2}&space;Z_{\lambda-\pi&space;/&space;2}" title="U(\theta, \phi, \lambda)=Z_{\phi-\pi / 2} X_{\pi / 2} Z_{\pi-\theta} X_{\pi / 2} Z_{\lambda-\pi / 2}" /></a>

We can obtain unitary gates for qutrits by applying 2-dimensional gates to the subspaces {|0〉,|1〉} and {|1〉,|2〉}. By doing so, we can decompose unitary qutrit gates as

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=U=Z_{\varphi_{1}}^{(01)}&space;Z_{\varphi_{2}}^{(12)}&space;Y_{\theta_{1}}^{(12)}&space;Y_{\theta_{2}}^{(01)}&space;Z_{\varphi_{3}}^{(01)}&space;Z_{\varphi_{4}}^{(12)}&space;Y_{\theta_{3}}^{(12)}&space;Z_{\varphi_{5}}^{(01)}&space;Z_{2&space;\varphi_{5}}^{(12)}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U=Z_{\varphi_{1}}^{(01)}&space;Z_{\varphi_{2}}^{(12)}&space;Y_{\theta_{1}}^{(12)}&space;Y_{\theta_{2}}^{(01)}&space;Z_{\varphi_{3}}^{(01)}&space;Z_{\varphi_{4}}^{(12)}&space;Y_{\theta_{3}}^{(12)}&space;Z_{\varphi_{5}}^{(01)}&space;Z_{2&space;\varphi_{5}}^{(12)}" title="U=Z_{\varphi_{1}}^{(01)} Z_{\varphi_{2}}^{(12)} Y_{\theta_{1}}^{(12)} Y_{\theta_{2}}^{(01)} Z_{\varphi_{3}}^{(01)} Z_{\varphi_{4}}^{(12)} Y_{\theta_{3}}^{(12)} Z_{\varphi_{5}}^{(01)} Z_{2 \varphi_{5}}^{(12)}" /></a>

The reason for doing that is because it is not trivial to find the pulses needed for applying a unitary gate to a qutrit, but it is easier to find the pulses corresponding to 2-dimensional X, Y, Z gates. Each subspace has a pulse frequency and amplitude that makes a rotation in its Bloch sphere, that means that adressing to one of the subspaces is made by setting the correct frequency and amplitude that won't affect the other subspace.

For our layers we have used only 4 gates:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=U=&space;Y_{\theta_{1}}^{(12)}&space;X_{\theta_{2}}^{(12)}&space;Y_{\theta_{3}}^{(01)}&space;X_{\theta_{4}}^{(01)}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U=&space;Y_{\theta_{1}}^{(12)}&space;X_{\theta_{2}}^{(12)}&space;Y_{\theta_{3}}^{(01)}&space;X_{\theta_{4}}^{(01)}" title="U= Y_{\theta_{1}}^{(12)} X_{\theta_{2}}^{(12)} Y_{\theta_{3}}^{(01)} X_{\theta_{4}}^{(01)}" /></a>

Where the angles will be determined by the classical data and the weights obtained from the training.

## Results
We started doing some simulations using the qutrit classifier, for that we first generated the training data from the three-class annulus problem. We then used these data points to train our model with 3 layers.

We wanted to check the accuracy of the model depending on the number of layers, for that we took the percentage of the data that was correctly predicted.

Finally, as a comparison we plotted the results from a 5 layer model to see the improvement.
