## Project Description 
We show how an online grocer will optimize between two objectives 1) selection on least number of suppliers provding all required inventory and 2) maximizing inventory profit. We provide a novel approach to solving competing supply-chain objectives through our Chained Optimization Rules Engine&reg; CORE&reg; method.

## Setup
1. Make sure you have Anaconda installed and configured.
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Original environment creation steps (only do this if step 2 did not work): 
```
conda create -n zebraket-cdl-hackathon-2021 python=3.9
source activate zebraket-cdl-hackathon-2021
conda install --name zebraket-cdl-hackathon-2021 ipykernel -y
conda install --name zebraket-cdl-hackathon-2021 pylint -y
conda install pandas==1.3.0
pip install dwave-ocean-sdk
```

## How to Use
Example:
python -m  services.classical_optimizers

## Challenges Solved

- Objective 1: We want to limit the number of suppliers based on the set of items they provide. This pre-selection was formulated into the "set cover" problem.

</p>

We convert this formulation into a binary quadratic model (BQM) and solve using D-Wave's Hybrid Solver with a small, medium and large dataset.  We then solve our "real" dataset.

- Objective 2: We want to maximize the overall profit by selecting an optimal set of inventory from the chosen suppliers while staying within our budget. This profit maximization is performed using the Knapsack formulation.

We develop a QUBO formulation of this using Andrew Lucas's formula[1].  However, we use our own Lagrange terms. We solve this also on a small, medium and large dataset.  We also then solve our "real" dataset.

## Project Details: 
  - Further walkthrough of what you did 

  The overall scope of our project was to show that multiple objectives can be handled together through a process of chaining and that gives comparable results to solving both objectives together.

  The diagram below shows the overall objectives and process. Detailed account of the formulae, QUBO and execution along with results are in the jupyter notebooks.
