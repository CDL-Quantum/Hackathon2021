## Project Details: 

#### Quantum Features selection

We use the Mutual Infirmation QUBO method to extract relevant features from a real-world data set of financial data. The techniques used where borrowed from this repository (https://github.com/dwave-examples/mutual-information-feature-selection).



#### Dynamic Portfolio Optimization problem

This work is inspired from the paper: *Dynamic Portfolio Optimization with Real Datasets Using Quantum Processors and Quantum-Inspired Tensor Networks* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00017). 

Our contributions include:  
- Using a feature selection tool for assets allocation during periodical rebalancing period
- Implement feature selection using a quantum annealer
- Comparing DWave processor portfolios with hybrid and classical solvers
