Our pricing tool is a quantum version of market data analysis. Data analysis is playing an increasingly important role in a range of industries, including the following:

## Retail
A typical data analysis application in retail is market basket analysis (MBA) or recommendation engines, where customers are assigned to particular groups depending on their purchases. Perhaps the best known users are Amazon, with its “customers who purchased this product also viewed this product” notices, and Netflix, with its movie recommendations. One study by Walmart famously used MBA to identify a connection between buying diapers and buying beer (the connection was dads). MBA is an unsupervised machine learning technique to analyze the purchasing patterns of the customers through transaction data. This information can be used for a variety of purposes, including store design, recommendations, sales promotions, and cross-selling. Another application is identifying key products, such as expensive or luxury items, which may not necessarily have high appeal themselves, but are linked with purchases of other goods.

## Healthcare
Similar forms of data analysis can be used to assist with medical diagnosis, by spotting clusters of symptoms or other attributes that are associated with a disease. They can also help to explore how drug treatments may be useful for classes of patients.

## Finance
Market data can be analysed to infer correlations between financial events. For example, transaction data can be classed into different categories which reflect market conditions.
