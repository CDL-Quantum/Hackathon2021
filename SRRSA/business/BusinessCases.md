## Motivation

As part of the IBM Challenge, our goal was not just to tackle the QIMP problem but also to propose potential applications and further researches. While working on the challenge we realized that the challenge at the heart of it is inability of classical computers to perform large computations. In today's data driven world, it becomes essential to address this problem. Machine learning with its innumerable applications faces this problem. This problem is addressed under what we know as an emerging field- Quantum Machine Learning. Quantum Machine Learning(QML) explores the implementation of ML algorithms using quantum computers. We could identify several areas of research in industry and academia where QML solutions are being explored. The bet QML makes is to offer a [qantum speedup](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09347.pdf).
